    "The name \"plane wave\" originates from the fact that the wavefront (where the wave assumes the same value) is a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction $\\mathbf{q}$. \n",

    "In solid-state physics, where one typically studies periodic crystalline solids, Bloch theorem tells us that\n",

    "The main advantage of this basis set is the possibility to use fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms to convert between the reciprocal-space representation (the coefficient of the plane waves) and the real-space representation of the wavefunctions on a grid. This is appealing because the operation of the potential on $\\psi$ is very simple in real space (since for local potentials it is simply an element-wise multiplication), while it is very efficient to compute the operation of the kinetic operator in reciprocal space, where the second derivative also becomes simply an element-wise multiplication. One can then pass between the two representations using FFTs, when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the number of plane waves (or, equivalently, of $\\mathbf G$ vectors) determines the size of the numerical problem to solve, it is important to find a balance between using enough plane waves to accurately represent the plane waves, but at the same time not too many, to avoid to make an overly expensive calculation.\n",
